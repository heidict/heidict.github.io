Extensible Shell
--------------------
*Language: C*

The extensible shell (esh) is a simple shell that provides a Unix-like command line user interface. The esh supports job control, pipes (\|), I/O redirection (< > >>), and can run programs that require exclusive access to the terminal (e.g. vim). It also implements the built-in commands ‘jobs,’ ‘fg,’ ‘bg,’ ‘kill,’ and ‘stop,’ along with ˆC (SIGINT) and ˆZ (SIGTSTP).
